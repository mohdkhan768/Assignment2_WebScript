This was a tough assignment, without the help of the videos and all the links provided in the canavs website, there was no way I would have done this.
I have done all the work myself, and spent longer just to make sure this works correctly. Majority of my work comes from 
my assignment 1 but the new stuff came fully from videos and youtube videos helping me initializing it. The code was majority converted and made better by using my previuos assignments and the lecture on javascript
did work.
